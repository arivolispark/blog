1-D array example:

A = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])

B = np.array([[2,2,2],[2,2,2]])

C = np.inner(A, B)

print(C)



A:
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]]


B:
[[2 2 2]
 [2 2 2]]


C:
[[12 12]
 [30 30]]

Common Table Expressions (CTE)

Perhaps its more meaningful to think of a CTE as a substitute for a view used for a single query. But doesn't require the overhead, metadata, or persistence of a formal view. Very useful when you need to:

Create a recursive query.
Use the CTE's resultset more than once in your query.
Promote clarity in your query by reducing large chunks of identical subqueries.
Enable grouping by a column derived in the CTE's resultset.

# Set vs JOIN

Set:  Vertical stacking
Join:  Horizontal stacking


Vertical stacking:
The number of columns and datatypes must match.  The number of rows can differ.

Horizontal stacking:
The number of columns and datatypes may mismatch.
